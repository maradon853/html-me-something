                    Chrysomallos, the golden winged ram, was the child of

                At one time, Zeus transformed his mistress, Lo, into the bull, Tarus.
                He also changed himself into a cow so they could be secret about
                their affair.

            <h2>Gemini</h2>
            <p>
                Castor, a mortal, and Pollux, a son of Zeus, were twin half brothers.
                Pollux asked his father to let him share his immortality with Castor,
                so Zeus transformed them into the constellation Gemini.

                A crab attacked Heracles, a son of Zeus, while he battled the many
                headed hydra.  Hera, Zeus' wife but Heracles' enemy, placed the crab
                among the stars as the constellation Cancer.

            <p>
                Zeus' daughter, Artemis, a hunter, had a handmaiden named Cyrene.
                Cyrene once battled and dominated a lion using her feminine powers
                of determination and strength, rather than brute force.

            <h2>Virgo</h2>
            <p>
                Artemis had a twin brother named Apollo, who had a daughter named 
                Parthenos, meaning virgin.  She died at a young age and Apollo made
                the constellation Virgo to commemorate her death.

            <h2>Libra</h2>
            <p>
                The constellation of Libra is based on Themis, who was the child of
                Gaia and Uranus (earth and sky).  She was a titoness, and one of 
                Zeus' lovers.  Her ability to forsee the future enabled her to 
                become one of the oracles of delphi, which led her to become the 
                goddess of divine justice.

            <h2>Scorpio</h2>
            <p>
                Artemis once sent a scorpion to battle Orion, who had threatned to
                hunt and kill all the animals in the world.  After the scorpion killed
                Orion, Zeus placed it in the sky as the constellation Scorpius, and did 
                the same for Orion, to remind mortals to curb excessive pride.

            <h2>Sagittarius</h2>
            <p>
                Some say this constellation is the image of the satyr Crotus,
                the son of Pan.  Crotus is seen as an archer, who's arrow is 
                pointed directly at the heart of Scorpius, possibly to avenge
                Orion.

            <h2>Capricorn</h2>
            <p>
                The constellation Capricornus is sometimes identified as Pan, but
                with a fish tail.  He once saved himself form the monster, Typhon,
                by transforming into part fish and swimming away in a river.

            <p>
                Ganymede, the son of the Trojan king, Tros, was taken by Zeus
                to mount olympius to be a cup carrier to the gods.  His vase 
                pours into the constellation of Piscis, the two fish.

            <h2>Pisces</h2>
            <p>
                Aphrodite, a daughter of Zeus, originally came from an egg from
                the sea.  Two fish rescued the egg and brought it to shore.  After
                she was born, she put them into the night sky as a form of gratitude
                and they became the constellation Pisces.
