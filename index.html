            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Chrysomallos was a special golden winged ram.  He was the child of Poseidon, who was Zeus’ brother.  
                Nephele, a cloud nymph, asked the ram to save her children, Phrixus and Helle, who were to be sacrificed by their 
                jealous stepmother, Ino.  After rescuing her children, Chrysomallos was sacrificed to Ares, the god of war, and became 
                the constellation Aries.

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp At one time, Zeus had transformed himself into a beautiful white bull to seduce the princess Europa.  
                They had an affair and children unbeknown to his wife, Hera.  Zeus created the constellation Taurus to commemorate 
                his love for Europa, as well as his stubbornness to capture the attention of those he desires.

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Castor and Pollux were twins, but also half brothers.  Castor was a mortal and Pollux was a demigod, the son of Zeus.  
                After Castor was fatally wounded in battle, Pollux asked his father to let him share his immortality with Castor.  Zeus 
                then transformed the twins into the constellation Gemini, granting them both access to Olympius and Hades.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Zeus had many children from adultery, one whom being Heracles.  Hera tried many times to destroy Heracles out of spite
                and jealousy.  She sent the crab, Karkinos, to attack Heracles while he battled the many headed hydra.  Heracles defeated 
                Karkinos, but Hera placed the crab in the stars as the constellation Cancer out of gratitude for his service.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp The constellation Leo is often connected to the tale of Heracles defeating the Nemean Lion.  But the lion is also connected 
                to the story of Cyrene, the handmaiden of Artemis, who was the huntress daughter of Zeus.  Cyrene once battled and dominated a 
                lion using her feminine powers of determination and strength, rather than masculine brute force.  Apollo, Artemis’ brother, witnessed 
                Cyrene’s fight with the lion, her victory causing him to fall in love with her.

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Apollo once saved the princess Parthenos and her sister Hemithea from a joint suicide attempt. They planned to jump off 
                a cliff to escape their father’s rath.  After saving them both, Apollo turned them into goddesses, and eventually turned 
                Parthenos into the constellation Virgo.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp The constellation of Libra is based on Themis, who was the child of Gaia and Uranus (earth and sky).  She was a titoness, 
                and one of Zeus' lovers.  Her ability to foresee the future enabled her to become one of the oracles of delphi, which led 
                her to become the goddess of divine justice.  This is why her constellation is symbolized by balancing scales.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Artemis once sent Scorpio, the scorpion, to battle Orion because had threatened to hunt and kill all the animals in the
                world.  After Scorpio killed Orion, Zeus placed it in the sky as the constellation Scorpius, and did the same for Orion.
                This was done to remind mortals to curb excessive pride.

            <a name = "sagittarius"></a>
            <h2>Sagittarius</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp While often depicted as a centaur, some say the constellation of Sagittarius is the image of the satyr Crotus, who was 
                the son of Pan.  Crotus is seen as an archer, who's arrow is pointed directly at the heart of Scorpius, possibly to 
                avenge Orion.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp The constellation Capricornus can be identified as Pan, the satyr god of the wild.  But he is depicted with a fish tail 
                instead of goat legs.  This is because Pan once saved himself from the monster, Typhon, by transforming into part fish and 
                swimming away in a river.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp The constellation Aquarius is based on Ganymede, the son of the Trojan king, Tros.  He was a handsome water bearer who 
                was taken by Zeus to mount olympus to be a cup carrier to the gods.  His vase pours into the constellation of Piscis, the 
                two fish.

            </figure>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Aphrodite, one of Zeus’ daughters, originally 
                came from an egg that was in the ocean.  Two fish rescued the egg and 
                brought it to shore.  After she was born, she put the fish into the night 
                sky as a form of gratitude and they became the constellation Pisces.
